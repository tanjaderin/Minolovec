## Project: Minesweeper Game

This project was completed as part of the **Introduction to Programming** course. It involves implementing a simplified version of the classic **Minesweeper** game.

### **Description:**
Minesweeper is a logic-based game where the player uncovers tiles on a grid, aiming to reveal all non-mine tiles without detonating any hidden mines. The player uses numerical clues, which indicate the number of mines in the adjacent tiles, to deduce the safe tiles to click on.

### **Key Features:**
- **Grid Generation**: The game initializes a grid with a specified number of mines placed randomly.
- **Tile Uncovering**: Players can reveal tiles, which display either a mine or a number indicating adjacent mines.
- **Game Mechanics**: The player wins by uncovering all non-mine tiles or loses if they uncover a mine.
- **User Input**: The game accepts user commands to uncover tiles or flag suspected mines.

### **Further Details:**
You can find the detailed rules and mechanics of Minesweeper on the [Minesweeper Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)).
